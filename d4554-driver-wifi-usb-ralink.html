Ahora son muchos los usuarios Hello, So, I run Debian stable and I have a usb wifi adapter that uses a chip from Ralink which is only half-supported by the builtin Linux driver (which is mt7601u). In order to make it work, I have to, first, boot into Windows, apparently to load the correct firmware into it, _then_ reboot into Debian -- otherwise, this happens: https://paste.debian.net/1016870/. Someone suggested trying a newer kernel and, after running OpenSUSE Tumbleweed, with Linux 4.15.11, the exact same thing happens. Just installed Arch Linux and I can't get my WiFi connection working. It was working fine using wifi-menu through the bootable usb installation but it's not working on the Arch Linux I just installed. Problem is I have to install the dialog package but I need an internet connection for that. I tried booting from the USB and installing it from there but the 'arch-chroot /mnt' command doesn't work anymore. I'm using a WiFi USB dongle called Ralink MT7601U Update: I booted I am currently working in a remote area on some federal land. Fortunately, there is a long-range outdoor AP that covers the bungalow I'm in. It's very weak. The built-in wifi I have on this HP Stream 11 works to make this post and not much else.

I've been mostly just lurking over the past few weeks, but if it weren't for all the great tutorials and guides that this community compiled, I don't think I would have ever managed to get to this point. Seeing how much all of this helped me, I thought it would only be fair to pay things forward by posting about my own journey. 
I recently invested in a 4k set that I assumed(wrongly) I would be able to use as a MediaPC without an external android box so bought a UHD set from Sony thinking I would be able to get 4k UI android desktop. After doing some research I bought a 8500D (x85D) which whilst I knew was running a 5.1.1 android system figured would have a relatively powerful CPU - being 4k and all. Turns out Sony have the viewport hard set to 1920x1080 and whilst it can do 4k - it only does so through by passing.

I would prefer to get a wireless N USB adapter but are they supported in "N" mode? I only allow "N" via my router, so "G" is no good for me. I know "N" is supported when it comes to PCI and PCIE/mini. But I can't find anything on whether N is supported I don't know how to install wifi adapter driver.
